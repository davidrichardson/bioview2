Exon/Feature/Genomic drawing components
---------------------------------------

FeatureType's will be need to be expanded to incorporate intron, domain will be
classed as exon.

The existing FeatureBean is adequate for holding the coordinate information,
although a higher level Transcript object to link multiple exons and introns
together will be needed.  Ideally a helper method will be used to generate a
Transcript object from a list of coordinates e.g. provide exon boundry
coordinates along with length of sequence, objects for each intron and exon
generated and stored in Tracnscript object automatically.  Ability to pass
multiple transcripts into the gene object (don't really want to build a full
gene modeling data structure, but if you want to keep rendering of multiple
transcripts simple this is probably the best way).

The scale will be generated based on the transcript/gene length.

For rendering of amplimers against the gene/transcript/exon... a list of domains
will be provided to the renderer.  This will use the existing 'bumping'
algortihm to prevent overlap of domains and calculation of image dimensions.
There should be the ability to display any labels for the respective domains.

A major function that should be provided is the ability to change the
orientation of the rendered image.  This is simple until text labels are
involved (however this may be handled fine by the transform function).

Advanced functions (harder things)
----------------------------------
Would love to provide image map overlay as this could allow additional
functionallity (when used in an application context), for example:
1. Ability to zoom into regions
2. Ability to select elements
