### Please be patient as I am doing this in my spare time ###

BioView was originally devised as a subcomponent of the [AutoCSA](http://www.sanger.ac.uk/genetics/CGP/Software/AutoCSA/) project (CGP - Sanger Institute).  The initial version only contains the Chromatogram rendering code for visulisation of sequencing data.  The main driving force of this was that the existing [BioJava](http://biojava.org/wiki/Main_Page) code was heavily biased towards processed data and was inefficient when rendering sub sections of chromatograms.

The intended future of BioView is to provide further easy to use components such as exon and chromosome mapping and visualisation tools.

All original code was made available under the BSD license and shall continue to be developed under this agreement.
