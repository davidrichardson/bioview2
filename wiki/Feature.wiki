What is a feature, why would you use it, what can it b applied to?


= Details =

Bioview currently has 5 different types of feature:

  # Domain
  # Variant call
  # Amplimer sequence
  # Inclusive boundry
  # Exclusive boundry

The function of these is as follows

=== Domain ===
This is a region of an image to be indicated using a boxed shaded bar of colour.
The mapping and orientation of this feature is dependent on the context of the master image is is being applied to.  In the case of a Chromatogram it will appear as a horizontal bar below the chromatogram image.  Multiple domains can be defined and should be used in conjunction with a legend (CookbookFeatureLegendImage)

=== Variant call ===
A variant call is an unboxed translucent shaded region which can be overlayed on an interesting portion of an image.  Currently the only expected use is to highlight variant base locations on a chromatogram.  For examples of this in use see the examples in [http://www.sanger.ac.uk/genetics/CGP/Software/AutoCSA/demo/BRAFexon11/variant-subPath-NCI-H1395-1-f.html Standalone AutoCSA].
