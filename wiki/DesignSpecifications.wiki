I hope to review and approve a basic specification of the initial aim of each component of the viewing tools prior to development.  To this end I have added a section into the repository tree so that they can be version controlled and edited easily.

All future developments must be documented in this way and approved prior to commencement of work.

The current specifications can be found [http://bioview2.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/specifications/ here] (svn/trunk/specifications/).

My own ideas will also be subject to approval by other members of the project and colleagues.

The main reason for this is to prevent the project from deviating from the original idea of a lightweight biological view generation tool.
